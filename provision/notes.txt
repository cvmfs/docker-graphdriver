Run this before provisioning.

For CentOS host:
----------------
- Kernel update
  - update machine and reboot (new kernel)

- OverlayFS unsupported version
  - create openstack volume
  - attach it to the machine
  - create partition table and format it to ext4
  - mount this ext4 partition to /var/spool/cvmfs


For ubuntu host:
---------------
Python is missing in the official ubuntu cloud image.
That means that Ansible will not work.
Just install python-minimal.
